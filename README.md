# **Local Food Waste Management (LFWM)**

A data-driven project to **reduce food wastage** by connecting food providers with receivers using **SQL analytics, EDA, and AI-powered predictions**.

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

Food wastage is a critical global issue, with tons of edible food discarded daily while millions go hungry.
The **Local Food Waste Management System** aims to bridge this gap by creating a platform where **restaurants, events, and individuals can donate surplus food**, and **NGOs or individuals in need can claim it**.

This project combines:
âœ” A **Streamlit Web App** for user interaction
âœ” **SQLite Database** for managing food listings and claims
âœ” **SQL Queries & Analytics** for insights
âœ” **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for patterns and trends
âœ” **Machine Learning Model** for predicting claim success
